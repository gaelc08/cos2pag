# cos2pag

Sets up replication of a single IBM Cloud Object Storage (COS) bucket to a
PoINT Archival Gateway (PAG) repository, driven by PoINT Data Replicator
(PDR).

For a given bucket name, running the tool does:

1. **COS** (`<accesser>:8338/container/{bucket}`)
   - `GET` the bucket to read its current ACL and IP whitelist (`firewall`).
   - `PATCH` the bucket, adding the configured backup service account to
     the ACL and the PDR IP to the firewall whitelist (existing entries are
     preserved — ACL and firewall are re-sent in full, since the API
     replaces them wholesale on PATCH).
   - `PATCH` the bucket's `notifications.topic` to the bucket's own name.
2. **PAG** (`/api/partitions`, `/api/partitions/{partitionUuid}/repositories`)
   - Use the partition named by the required `--tenant` argument (one
     partition per tenant). This is never guessed from the bucket name:
     real tenant codes share common prefixes (`ME`, `ME-SR`, `ME-SRE`,
     `ME-SRE2`; `ACT`, `ACT-GEOPORTAL`, `ACT-ILDG`; ...), so deriving it
     automatically risks silently picking the wrong tenant. If that
     partition doesn't exist yet, it's created with the settings in
     `pag.new_partition_defaults` (a static config block you fill in
     once, e.g. copied from an existing reference partition like
     "costotape") — only the name differs.
   - Create an object repository with the same name as the COS bucket in
     that partition, owned by the configured PDR user (or reuse it and
     update its owner if it already exists).
3. **PDR** (`/api/tasks`)
   - Create a replication task from the COS bucket (S3 source) to the PAG
     repository (S3 target), including copy/deletion options
     (`pdr.copy_options`), a schedule (`pdr.schedule`), and Kafka/SQS
     object-change notifications for the task itself (`pdr.notifications`,
     separate from `cos.notifications`) if configured. The Kafka topic
     defaults to the bucket's own name, same convention as COS.

Every step is idempotent: re-running the tool on a bucket that is already
fully set up is a no-op (each step is reported as `SKIPPED`/`OK`).

## Note on `sosapi_enabled`

`sosapiEnabled` on a PAG repository does **not** gate plain S3 access —
the repository is reachable over standard S3 (what PDR uses) regardless
of this flag. "SOSAPI" here is a Veeam-specific protocol extension on top
of S3 (for Veeam Backup & Replication's object storage integration),
gated by a separate "Veeam SOSAPI" license option. This tool defaults
`pag.sosapi_enabled` to `false` since it isn't needed for PDR replication;
only set it `true` if you specifically need that Veeam extension and have
it licensed (otherwise it fails with a 500 "product license does not
cover this function" / `ModifyObjectRepository`).

## Install

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Configure

```
cp config.example.yaml config.yaml
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `config.yaml` for anything environment-specific (endpoints,
partition, owner, etc. — see below), and edit `.env` for secrets (never
committed, listed in `.gitignore`). `config.yaml`'s `${VAR_NAME}`
placeholders are resolved from the environment at load time, and
`python -m cos2pag` loads `.env` into the environment automatically
before that happens — no need to `export` anything by hand each time.
Use `--env-file <path>` if you keep secrets somewhere other than `.env`.

`config.example.yaml` is pre-filled with this environment's known
endpoints:

| System | Admin/Service API endpoint | S3 data-plane endpoint | Auth |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| COS | `osiris-109-a-fe.ctie.etat.lu:8338` | `s3.govcloud.etat.lu:443` | basic |
| PAG | `scrat-1.ctie.etat.lu:4200` | `scrat-1.ctie.etat.lu:4443` | basic |
| PDR | `hathor-1.ctie.etat.lu:3601` | n/a | basic |

The admin/service endpoints are used for bucket ACL/firewall/notifications
(COS) and repository/task management (PAG/PDR). The S3 data-plane
endpoints are what PDR actually connects to as `source_s3`/`target_s3` to
copy objects — they run on different ports than the admin APIs, so don't
mix them up.

## Run

```
python -m cos2pag my-bucket-name --tenant CTIE-001 --config config.yaml
```

`--tenant` is required (the PAG partition/tenant name) — it's never
guessed from the bucket name, since real tenant codes are ambiguous
prefixes of each other (see above). If that partition doesn't exist yet,
this run creates it.

Add `--dry-run` to see what would be sent without making any mutating
request (`GET`s are still executed so the plan reflects real current
state), and `-v` for debug logging.

## Important safety note on the IP whitelist

If a bucket currently has **no** `allowed_ip` list at all, it is reachable
from any IP not explicitly denied. Sending a PATCH with
`firewall.allowed_ip: [<pdr ip>]` in that situation does not "add" an
entry — it **creates** a whitelist and immediately locks the bucket down
to that single IP. To avoid silently breaking existing access, the tool
refuses to do this by default and reports the `cos.firewall` step as
skipped with a warning. Set `cos.allow_create_whitelist: true` in the
config if that lock-down is actually what you want.

## Notes on API references used

- COS: *IBM Cloud Object Storage System — Container Mode Service API Guide
  — Bucket Management* (v3.20.x). Confirmed to use HTTP basic auth in this
  environment; the tool also supports `bearer` auth if that ever changes
  (set `cos.auth.type`).
- PAG: `pag-swagger.json` (PoINT Archival Gateway Administration API v1).
  A "bucket" is an Object Repository; the owner assigned to it is set via
  the `owner` field (`uuid` + `type`: `User`/`Group`/`ESP`).
- PDR: `pdr-swagger.json` (PoINT Data Replicator Administration API V1).
  A replication task's `source`/`target` are configured as S3 endpoints
  (`ApiTaskOptions.s3`).
